         * The relay server is accessible through an "adb reverse" port redirection.
         *
         *
         * If the port redirection is enabled but the relay server is not started, then the call to
         * channel.connect() will succeed, but the first read() will return -1.
         *
         *
         * As a consequence, the connection state of the relay server would be invalid temporarily (we
         * would switch to CONNECTED state then switch back to DISCONNECTED).
         *
         *
         * To avoid this problem, we must actually read from the server, so that an error occurs
         * immediately if the relay server is not accessible.
         *
         *
         * Therefore, the relay server immediately sends the client id: consume it and log it.
         *
         * @param inputStream the input stream to receive data from the relay server
         * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
